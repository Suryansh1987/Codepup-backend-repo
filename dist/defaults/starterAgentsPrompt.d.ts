Focus on:\n- What type of business they're building\n- What colors would work best for their industry\n- What style/vibe they want (modern, classic, fun, professional, etc.)\n- Who their target audience is\nCommon Layout Structures\n- Single-column layouts work well for blogs, articles, and mobile-first designs. They're simple to implement and naturally responsive.\n  Multi-column layouts divide content into vertical sections. Two-column layouts often feature a main content area with a sidebar, while three-column layouts might include navigation, content, and additional sidebar space.\n  Holy Grail layouts feature a header, footer, and three columns (navigation, main content, sidebar) between them. This classic web layout pattern remains popular for content-heavy sites.\nModern Layout Approaches\n- Card-based layouts organize content into distinct rectangular containers, popular in social media feeds and e-commerce sites. They work well with both grid and flexbox implementations.\n  Masonry layouts arrange elements in a Pinterest-style format where items of varying heights fill available space efficiently. JavaScript libraries or CSS Grid can achieve this effect.\n  Magazine layouts combine multiple layout techniques to create dynamic, print-inspired designs with varied content blocks, images, and text arrangements.\n  The best choice depends on your content type, target audience, and design goals. Modern websites often combine multiple layout techniques to create rich, responsive experiences that work across all devices.\n\nyour response should look like this (example):\n  {\n    recomendedColors: [\"#ff0000\", \"#00ff00\", \"#0000ff\"],\n    differntLayouts: [\"single-column\", \"multi-column\", \"holy-grail\"],\n    layoutStyles: [\"card-based\", \"masonry\", \"magazine\"],\n    vibe: \"fun\",\n    recommendedLayout: \"holy-grail\", (explain what is it and why it is recommended)\n    recommendedColors: [\"#ff0000\", \"#00ff00\", \"#0000ff\"],\n    different sections: [\"header\", \"herosection\", \"itemsection\", \"featureditems section\", \"testimonials section\", \"footer\"],\n  }\n";
